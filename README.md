# Football Team Cards Project Readme

This project involves building a webpage that displays information about a football team, including team stats and player cards. Users can filter the player cards based on various criteria such as position and nickname.

## Files Included

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the webpage.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for dynamic functionality of the webpage.

## HTML Structure

- The HTML file includes elements for displaying team stats such as team name, sport, year, and head coach.
- It also includes a dropdown menu for filtering player cards and a section for displaying the player cards.

## CSS Styling

- The CSS file contains styling rules for the webpage, including colors, font sizes, and layout adjustments.
- It styles the team stats section, player cards, and other elements for a visually appealing design.

## JavaScript Functionality

- The JavaScript file fetches data about a favorite football team and populates the webpage with relevant information.
- It dynamically updates the team stats section with data about the team name, sport, year, and head coach.
- Player cards are generated dynamically based on the data of each player in the team.
- Users can filter player cards by selecting options from the dropdown menu, such as filtering by position or nickname.
- The script handles user input and updates the displayed player cards accordingly.

## Project Completion

- The project is completed with the addition of a default clause in the JavaScript switch statement to handle cases where none of the filter options are selected.
- When the default option is selected, all player cards are displayed.
- The project is now fully functional and ready for use.
